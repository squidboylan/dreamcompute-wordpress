DreamCompute WordPress Ansible Playbook
=======================================

This is a Ansible playbook for deploying a single node simple WordPress site.
The purpose of having a playbook that can do this is to be able to deploy
different verions of vanilla WordPress in order to do performance testing. This
playbook is not meant to deploy a production site, but could be modified to do
so.
